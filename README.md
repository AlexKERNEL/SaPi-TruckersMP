# SaPi [TruckersMP]

This is an old tool created by [jackrv](https://github.com/jackrv/), which AlexKERNEL updated in order to work with TruckersMP as it was working only with the old ETS2MP website, CaptainKostaZ fixed the website links and updated the logos with our new logos on options and popup tab.
 
This tool is a chrome extension which allows you see user's TruckersMP ID,Steam ID and also a link to user's profile. This is a helpful tool for the support job when you need to find user's profile on TruckersMP.

In order to install this chrome extension you will have to add the extension in Chrome with enabled Developer Mode ([see how](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)). User "src" Folder.
